Report: Impact of Inflation on Labor Productivity

1. Data Analysis:

The analysis was conducted based on a model where labor productivity is assumed to be proportional to real wages.
Monthly inflation of 3.3% and yearly inflation of 24.8% were considered.
The nominal salary per month was set at 70,000 units.
2. Calculated Values:

Real salaries were computed by adjusting for inflation on both a monthly and yearly basis.
Labor productivity was calculated using the assumption of an inverse relationship with inflation.
Key Findings:

The analysis revealed that labor productivity decreases as inflation rises, following the simplified model.
The productivity indices for the monthly and yearly periods were determined based on the provided inflation rates.
4. Visualization:

A bar plot was generated to visually represent the impact of inflation on labor productivity.
The plot showcases the labor productivity index for the monthly and yearly periods, highlighting the inverse relationship with inflation.
5. Conclusion:

The analysis indicates that inflation can have a negative impact on labor productivity, as seen in the model assumptions.
Understanding the dynamics between inflation and productivity is crucial for assessing economic trends and workforce performance.
